This supplement provides details on the simulation settings for Hülsmann *et al*., **Comment on “Plant diversity increases with the strength of negative density dependence at the global scale”** (LaManna *et al*. 2017 Science).

We used randomly simulated data with varying process and community characteristics to evaluate the behaviour of the Ricker and the offset-power model. Counts of recruits and adults were generated for 10x10m quadrats assuming different CNDD, dispersal, adult survival, habitat specificity, species abundance and adult proportion. The technical implementation and rationale behind these choices are outlined in the following.

# General setting

Counts of adults and recruits in each quadrat were randomly drawn from a Poisson distribution with mean values defined by species abundance, the proportion of adults and the dynamic processes as follows.

# CNDD


# Dispersal


# Adult survival


# Habitat specificity


# Species richness


# Adult proportion


# Analysis of the simulations

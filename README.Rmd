This repository provides code and explanations of the simulated scenarios for Hülsmann & Hartig **Comment on “Plant diversity increases with the strength of negative density dependence at the global scale”**. In review for *Science*. This paper is a technical comment on LaManna *et al*, *Science* (2017).

The material is organized in four subfolders

* [**Fig1**](https://github.com/LisaHuelsmann/CommentTo-LaMannaEtAl-Science/tree/master/Fig1): This subfolder contains the materials necessary to reproduce Fig. 1 in Hülsmann & Hartig (2018)  
* [**Fig2**](https://github.com/LisaHuelsmann/CommentTo-LaMannaEtAl-Science/tree/master/Fig2): This subfolder contains the materials necessary to reproduce Fig. 2 in Hülsmann & Hartig (2018)  
* [**code**](https://github.com/LisaHuelsmann/CommentTo-LaMannaEtAl-Science/tree/master/code): This subfolder contains the R code used in Figs. 1,2 for
    + the simulation null models, as well as an explanation of their motivation
    + the CNDD analyses using the Ricker and offset-power model
* [**data**](https://github.com/LisaHuelsmann/CommentTo-LaMannaEtAl-Science/tree/master/data): This subfolder contains the data preparation scripts, and should also contain the raw data of BCI, which must be independently requested at http://ctfs.si.edu/webatlas/datasets/bci/
